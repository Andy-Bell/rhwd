# Rhwd

### Name
Rhwd - short for "Fy fframwaith gwe Rhwd" - "My rust web framework" in Welsh

### Purpose
The purpose of this library is for me to experiment with how async/await has
affected how I want to work with rust for web based applications, and hopefully
get a working web framework out of it that will:

- handle json
- talk to database
- be ergonomic
- handle CORS
- handle authentication
